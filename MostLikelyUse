Simplest call.

calk iwconfig
find wifi card name
in mant cases this is wlo1 on distros like Fedora

sudo ./lnxrouter --ap <yourwirelessdevice> <newhotspotname> -p <yourpassword> -g <thenewserversipaddress>

-g is important otherwise the server address changes everytime.
also, unless dhcp is properly configured you're going to have to statically address your clients.
