# Linux-router

Set Linux as router in one command. Able to provide Internet, or create WiFi hotspot. Support transparent proxy (redsocks). Also useful for routing VM/containers.

It wraps `iptables`, `dnsmasq` etc. stuff. Use in one command, restore in one command or by `control-c` (or even by closing terminal window).

## Features

Basic features:

- Create a NATed sub-network
- Provide Internet
- DHCP server (and RA)
  - Specify what DNS the DHCP server assigns to clients
- DNS server
  - Specify upstream DNS (kind of a plain DNS proxy)
- IPv6 (behind NATed LAN, like IPv4)
- Creating WiFi hotspot:
  - Channel selecting
  - Choose encryptions: WPA2/WPA, WPA2, WPA, No encryption
  - Create AP on the same interface you are getting Internet (usually require same channel)
- Transparent proxy (redsocks)
- Transparent DNS proxy (hijack port 53 packets)
- Detect NetworkManager and make sure it won't interfere (handle interface (un)managed status)
- You can run many instances, to create many different networks. Has instances managing feature.

**For many other features, see below [CLI usage](#cli-usage-and-other-features)**

### Useful in these situations

```
Internet----(eth0/wlan0)-Linux-(wlanX)AP
                                       |--client
                                       |--client
```

```
                                    Internet
WiFi AP(no DHCP)                        |
    |----(wlan1)-Linux-(eth0/wlan0)------
    |           (DHCP)
    |--client
    |--client
```

```
                                    Internet
 Switch                                 |
    |---(eth1)-Linux-(eth0/wlan0)--------
    |--client
    |--client
```

```
Internet----(eth0/wlan0)-Linux-(eth1)------Another PC
```

```
Internet----(eth0/wlan0)-Linux-(virtual interface)-----VM/container
```

## Usage

### Provide Internet to an interface

```
sudo lnxrouter -i eth1
```

no matter which interface (other than `eth1`) you're getting Internet from.

### Create WiFi hotspot

```
sudo lnxrouter --ap wlan0 MyAccessPoint -p MyPassPhrase
```

no matter which interface you're getting Internet from (even from `wlan0`). Will create virtual Interface `x0wlan0` for hotspot.

### Provide an interface's Internet to another interface

Clients access Internet through only `isp5`

<details>

```
sudo lnxrouter -i eth1 -o isp5  --no-dns  --dhcp-dns 1.1.1.1  -6 --dhcp-dns6 [2606:4700:4700::1111]
```

> In this case of usage, it's recommended to:
> 
> 1. Stop serving local DNS
> 2. Tell clients which DNS to use ISP5's DNS. (Or, a safe public DNS, like above example)

> Also, read *Notice 1*

</details>

### LAN without Internet

<details>

```
sudo lnxrouter -n -i eth1
sudo lnxrouter -n --ap wlan0 MyAccessPoint -p MyPassPhrase
```

> Read _Notice 1_

</details>

### Internet for LXC

<details>

Create a bridge

```
sudo brctl addbr lxcbr5
```

In LXC container `config`

```
lxc.network.type = veth
lxc.network.flags = up
lxc.network.link = lxcbr5
lxc.network.hwaddr = xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
```

```
sudo lnxrouter -i lxcbr5
```

</details>

### Transparent proxy

All clients' Internet traffic go through, for example, Tor

<details>

```
sudo lnxrouter -i eth1 --tp 9040 --dns 9053 -g 192.168.55.1 -6 --p6 fd00:5:6:7::
```

In `torrc`

```
TransPort 192.168.55.1:9040 
DNSPort 192.168.55.1:9053
TransPort [fd00:5:6:7::1]:9040 
DNSPort [fd00:5:6:7::1]:9053
```

</details>

### Clients-in-sandbox network

To not give our infomation to clients. Clients can still access Internet.

<details>

```
sudo lnxrouter -i eth1 \
    --tp 9040 --dns 9053 \
    --random-mac \
    --ban-priv \
    --catch-dns --log-dns   # optional
```

</details>

> This script comes with no warrenty. Use on your own risk

### Use as transparent proxy for LXD

<details>

Create a bridge

```
sudo brctl addbr lxdbr5
```

Create and add a new LXD profile overriding container's `eth0`

```
lxc profile create profile5
lxc profile edit profile5

### profile content ###
config: {}
description: ""
devices:
  eth0:
    name: eth0
    nictype: bridged
    parent: lxdbr5
    type: nic
name: profile5

lxc profile add <container> profile5
```

```
sudo lnxrouter -i lxdbr5 --tp 9040 --dns 9053
```

To remove that new profile from container

```
lxc profile remove <container> profile5
```

#### To not use profile

Add new `eth0` to container overriding default `eth0`

```
lxc config device add <container> eth0 nic name=eth0 nictype=bridged parent=lxdbr5
```

To remove the customized `eth0` to restore default `eth0`

```
lxc config device remove <container> eth0
```

</details>

### Use as transparent proxy for VirtualBox

<details>

In VirtualBox's global settings, create a host-only network `vboxnet5` with DHCP disabled.

```
sudo lnxrouter -i vboxnet5 --tp 9040 --dns 9053
```

</details>

### Use as transparent proxy for firejail

<details>

Create a bridge

```
sudo brctl addbr firejail5
```

```
sudo lnxrouter -i firejail5 -g 192.168.55.1 --tp 9040 --dns 9053 
firejail --net=firejail5 --dns=192.168.55.1 --blacklist=/var/run/nscd
```

Firejail's `/etc/resolv.conf` doesn't obtain DNS from DHCP, so we need to assign.

nscd is domain name cache service, which shouldn't be accessed from in jail here.

</details>

                            (Note IPv6 addresses need '[]' around)
                            Using both above two will enable '--no-dns' 
    --hostname <name>       DNS server associate this name with this host.
                            Use '-' to read name from /etc/hostname

    --stop <id>             Stop a running instance
        For <id> you can use PID or subnet interface name.
        You can get them with '--list-running'
```

## Notice

<details>

```
    Notice 1:   This script assume your host's default policy won't forward
                packets, so the script won't explictly ban forwarding in any
                mode. In some unexpected case (eg. mistaken configurations) may
                cause unwanted packets leakage between 2 networks, which you
                should be aware of if you want isolated network
```

</details>

## What changes are done to Linux system

On exit of a linux-router instance, script **will do cleanup**, i.e. undo most changes to system. Though, **some** changes (if needed) will **not** be undone, which are:

1. `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward = 1` and `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding = 1`
2. dnsmasq in Apparmor complain mode
3. hostapd in Apparmor complain mode
4. Kernel module `nf_nat_pptp` loaded
5. The wifi device which is used to create hotspot is `rfkill unblock`ed
6. WiFi country code, if user assigns

## Install

1-file-script. Download and run (meet the dependencies).

I'm currently not packaging for any distro. If you do, open a PR and add the link (can be with a version badge) to list here:

| Linux distro |                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Any          | download [1-file-script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garywill/linux-router/master/lnxrouter) and run |

## Dependencies

- bash
- procps or procps-ng
- iproute2
- dnsmasq
- iptables (or nftables with `iptables-nft` translation linked)
- WiFi hotspot dependencies
  - hostapd
  - iw
  - iwconfig (you only need this if 'iw' can not recognize your adapter)
  - haveged (optional)

## TODO

Sooner is better:
- Detect firewalld and make sure it won't interfere our interface

Future:
- WPA3
- Global IPv6
- Explictly ban forwarding if not needed
- Bring bridging method back
